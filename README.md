# Enrique Moreno Tent - Personal blog

This is my personal blog, built with Jekyll, and deployed in Netlify.

## Local Development

First install dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

Then execute the development server

```bash
bundle exec jekyll server --watch
```

Now navigate to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to preview the site, and
[localhost:4000/admin](http://localhost:4000/admin) to log into the CMS.
