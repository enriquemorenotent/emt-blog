            <p>While working in a great advertising agency, I came to work with this project for the city of Berlin, where many interesting information about the city is still being posted. One of the many projects I built using TYPO3, a very popular CMS in Germany.</p>

            <p>This is a small website built to create polls. It is main purpose was to get me get familiarized with the Laravel framework. The experience was quite enjoyable, and probably the most fun I ever had programming in PHP.</p>

            <h1>Bookcaneer</h1>
            <p>I had been tinkering around with Ruby on Rails for a long time, and I was dying to put something in production using this framework. Looking through my house I saw a good amount of books that I did not want anymore, and I thought what would be the best way to get rid of them. That is when I came to the idea of building a website that could be use for giving away books that were no longer wanted.</p>
