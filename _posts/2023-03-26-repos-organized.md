As a developer, it's easy to accumulate a large number of GitHub repositories. For me, it can be overwhelming to keep track of them all and remember what each one does. So, I decided to make a list of my most important repositories by categories, along with a brief description of what they are. This way, I can have a better overview of my codebase and easily find what I'm looking for.

## Templates and boilerplates

- [npm-package-bootstrap](https://github.com/enriquemorenotent/npm-package-bootstrap): A boilerplate to make new NPM packages.

## WordPress

- [wordpress-accordion-block](https://github.com/enriquemorenotent/wordpress-accordion-block): A WordPress block for creating an accordion-style layout.
- [wordpress-emt-section-block](https://github.com/enriquemorenotent/wordpress-emt-section-block): A WordPress block for creating sections with a customizable background color.
- [wordpress-logo-showcase-block](https://github.com/enriquemorenotent/wordpress-logo-showcase-block): A WordPress block for showcasing logos with customizable sizes and styles.
- [wordpress-feature-table-block](https://github.com/enriquemorenotent/wordpress-feature-table-block): A WordPress block for creating a feature comparison table.
- [wordpress-slideshow-block](https://github.com/enriquemorenotent/wordpress-slideshow-block): A WordPress block for creating a customizable slideshow.

## React

- [wordpress-hooks](https://github.com/enriquemorenotent/wordpress-hooks): A React library for using WordPress API.


## Visual Studio Code Extensions

- [vscode-extension-foldercode](https://github.com/enriquemorenotent/vscode-extension-foldercode): A Visual Studio Code extension to sum up the codebase of a project.

I hope this list can be helpful for other developers who are also struggling to keep track of their repositories. While these projects were made for my personal use, I encourage anyone to use them as a reference or starting point for their own projects. Who knows, maybe they'll even catch the eye of a curious recruiter looking for a talented developer.

So, what about you? Do you have any repositories that you're particularly proud of? Let me know in the comments!
