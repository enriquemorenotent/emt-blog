title: Scientific notation literal in Javascript
---
Today I Learned that there is a thing called “scientific notation literals” in Javascript. Let’s see some examples.

```javascript
1E10 // returns 100000000002E4 // return 200002.5E2 // Also with floats! returns 250
```

This method might prove useful to describe certain amount of numbers.
