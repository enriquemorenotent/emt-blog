# Building Custom Blocks for WordPress: A Comprehensive Guide

Are you tired of the limited options for blocks in WordPress? Do you want to customize your website even further? Then building custom blocks may be the solution for you!

In this series, we will guide you through the process of building custom blocks for WordPress. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, our step-by-step approach will help you create custom blocks that will enhance your website.

## Part 1: Getting Started

To get started, all you need to do is use the command below inside the plugins folder:

```sh
npx @wordpress/create-block my-custom-block
```

This command will prepare everything necessary to create your custom block. Once you have created the folder, go to the “plugins” section of WordPress, where you will see your newly created plugin listed. Activate it, and you can then include your new block in any post or page.

In the next blog post, we will describe what every file does. But if you can’t wait and are curious about how the default native blocks of WordPress are built, you can check out this link:
