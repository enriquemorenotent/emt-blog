You just installed the latest Ubuntu distro (right now 18.04) are you are dying to know what should you do first, right? This is in my list.


```
# Update the system
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade

# Enable additional software!
# Go to "Software & Updates" and be sure to include all the repos in there. And since you are there, choose a server that is close-by.

# Install media codecs
sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras

# Install video player
sudo apt install vlc

# Install graphics editor
sudo apt install gimp

```

## Install other 3rd party software 

* Time to install [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Unless you are happy enough with Firefox, of course.

* I want to hear music. Time to download [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/de/download/linux/).

* Everyone loves animated GIFs. Go make some with [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek).

* You are using Linux so you must program, in some sort or way. You are gonna need either [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/linux_repositories.html), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/).

## Other settings
* Go to "Settings -> Devices -> Displays" and set those night lights. We all need a good night sleep.
